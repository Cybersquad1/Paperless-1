## Synopsis (Summary)

The system manages documents, users and user roles. Each document defines access rights; the document defines which roles can access it. Also, each document specifies the date it was published.

Users are categorized by roles. Each user must have a role defined for them.

Paperless uses an external API that handles data information processing and data storage.
